Crime Hotspot Detection Using Geospatial Visualisation and Unsupervised Clustering
<br>
The increasing availability of open crime data and advances in geospatial analytics provide new
opportunities for understanding the spatial dynamics of criminal activity. This study investigates
the identification and interpretation of crime hotspots in the United Kingdom using unsupervised
machine learning and geospatial visualisation techniques. Street-level crime and outcome data
published by UK police forces were integrated and analysed using Python-based analytics and
Tableau dashboards. Following extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, density-based
clustering methods, specifically DBSCAN and HDBSCAN, were applied to detect spatial
concentrations of crime. A representative random sample of 50,000 records was used to ensure
computational feasibility. The findings show that crime is highly concentrated in specific microlocations, particularly within major urban centres, and that many hotspots persist over time.
Analysis of crime type composition and investigative outcomes reveals substantial variation
across hotspots. The study demonstrates that combining unsupervised clustering with interactive
visual analytics provides a reproducible and applied framework for crime hotspot analysis and
evidence-based decision-making
